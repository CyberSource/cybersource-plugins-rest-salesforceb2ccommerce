### **6. Capture Service**

A single function is available to make capture requests.

    httpCapturePayment(requestID, merchantRefCode, purchaseTotal, currency)

This function can be found in the script **‘scripts/http/capture.js’**. A working example of how to use this function can be found in the **ServiceFrameworkTest-TestCaptureService** controller. You will first get an instance of the capture.js object, and make the call as follows:

    var captureObj = require("~/cartridge/scripts/http/capture.js");
    var serviceResponse = captureObj.httpCapturePayment(requestID, merchantRefCode, paymentTotal, currency);

The resulting serviceResponse object will contain the full response object generated by the request. The contents of this object will determine your logic in handling errors and successes. For detailed explanations of all possible fields and values, refer this [link](https://developer.cybersource.com/api-reference-assets/index.html#payments_capture) .

**Capture Request Parameters**

Parameter Name | Description
------------ | -------------
requestID | Transaction ID obtained from the initial Authorization
merchantRefCode | SFCC Order Number
purchaseTotal | Order Total
currency | Currency code (ex. ‘USD’)



### **6. Auth Reversal Service**

A single function is available to make auth reversal requests.

    httpAuthReversal(requestID, merchantRefCode,  amount, currency)

This function can be found in the script **‘scripts/http/authReversal.js’**. A working example of how to use this function can be found in the **ServiceFrameworkTest- TestAuthReversal** controller. You will first get an instance of the AuthReversal.js object, and make the call as follows:

    var reversalObj = require("~/cartridge/scripts/http/authReversal.js");
    var serviceResponse = reversalObj.httpAuthReversal(requestID, merchantRefCode, paymentTotal, currency);

The resulting serviceResponse object will contain the full response object generated by the request. The contents of this object will determine your logic in handling errors and successes. For detailed explanations of all possible fields and values, refer this [link](https://developer.cybersource.com/api-reference-assets/index.html#payments_reversal_process-an-authorization-reversal)

**Authorization Reversal Request Parameter**

Parameter Name | Description
------------ | -------------
requestID | Transaction ID obtained from the initial Authorization
merchantRefCode | SFCC Order Number
amount | Order Total
currency | Currency code (ex. ‘USD’)



### **7. Advanced Customization**

The Cybersource SFRA cartridge has built-in custom hooks that can be utilized to customize request data being sent to each Service.  This can be utilized to send additional custom data that the core cartridge cannot account for.  For example, if you want to include Merchant Defined Data in your Credit Card Authorization Requests, you can use these hooks to achieve this.  

The hooks are called in the **‘scripts/http/capture.js’** and **‘scripts/http/AuthReversal.js’** scripts.  After a request for a particular service is built, but before it is sent to CS, a check for any code registering to the hook ‘app.payment.modifyrequest’ is done.  If present, the hook will be called for that specific request.  The request object is passed into the hook and the return value of the hook is sent to CS as the final request object.  Through this process, you can inject your own data into the request object from custom code you write in a separate cartridge.

**Implementation:**

To customize request objects, register the hook **‘app.payment.modifyrequest’** in your cartridges **‘hooks.json’** file.  An example would look like this, replacing the script path with your own script :

``` JSON
    {
        "name": "app.payment.modifyrequest",
        "script": "./cartridge/scripts/hooks/modifyRequestExample"
    }
``` 

You can copy the **‘scripts/hooks/modifyRequestExample’** script from this cartridge into your own to use as a template for extending and modifying service request objects.  Note, every hook must return a valid request object for the given service.  It is recommended that you reference the CybserSource documentation for details on the exact nature of any fields you wish to customize or add. The following hooks are available for you to define in this file:

**Modify Request hooks**

Hook Name | Service Request to modify
------------ | -------------
AuthReversal | Credit Card Authorization Reversal
Capture | Credit Card Capture
